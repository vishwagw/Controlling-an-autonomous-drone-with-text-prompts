# Controlling an autonomous drone with prompt based application:

With recent developments of drones (specially with autonomous drones), it is important to have new and easy ways to communicate with your drone. This is project was started to build a text prompt based control system. 

1. purposes:
The major purpose is to create more easy way to execute autonomous drone movements. using a text prompt based inputs can be used to stop executing whole algorithm itself manually in a terminal. 

2. Basic info:
The initial program is build on Python program. 
The program is using GUI as user interface to interact with drone user. 
I have also added a display unit for viewing input/output results and animation corner to understand drone movements. 

3. features:
* autonomous take off
* autonomous landing
* acsend
* decsend
* hover
* system status
* forward / backward movements
* left / right movements
* stop

4. measurement:
* Altitude
* position
* direction

For emergency purposes, we have also added primary control button section in the bottom. So user only need to press the button rather than entering texts in an emergency.
